Simple Javascript eXtension Framework
==


The simple Javascript eXtension framework (jx in short) implements wrappers around common tasks performed on DOM object, JSON object and implements various utilities like **design patterns** for 
* easy handling of collections 
* as well as mathematic functions 
* and some basic machine learning techniques and models. 

Jx plays well with existing frameworks like jQuery; Dojo; Mootools; Backbone; Boostrap. We put in a concerted effort to keep it simple yet useful.
